# Complete Guide to Setting Up Inventory Management

This guide provides a comprehensive overview of setting up the inventory management system for BiziShop.

## Overview

The inventory management system allows shop owners and managers to:

- Track inventory levels for all products
- Receive alerts for low stock items
- Manage suppliers
- Track upcoming deliveries
- View inventory reports

## Setup Steps

Follow these steps to set up the inventory management system:

### 1. Set Up Firebase Collections

Create the following collections in your Firebase database:

- `inventory`: Stores inventory items and stock levels
- `suppliers`: Stores supplier information
- `deliveries`: Tracks upcoming deliveries
- `stockMovements`: Tracks inventory changes

Refer to the `INVENTORY_SETUP_GUIDE.md` file for detailed instructions on setting up these collections.

### 2. Add Sample Data

Add sample data to test the functionality of the inventory management system:

- Add inventory items linked to your existing products
- Add suppliers for your inventory items
- Add upcoming deliveries from suppliers
- Add stock movements to track inventory changes

Refer to the `SAMPLE_DATA.md` file for sample data you can use.

### 3. Configure Firebase Security Rules

Add security rules to protect your inventory data:

- Only owners and managers can create and update inventory items
- Only owners can delete inventory items
- Cashiers can only view inventory items

Refer to the `FIREBASE_SECURITY_RULES.md` file for the complete security rules.

### 4. Add Inventory to Navigation

Add the inventory page to your application's navigation menu:

- Update the navigation component to include an inventory link
- Update the router to include the inventory route
- Update role-based access control to allow access to the inventory page

Refer to the `ADD_INVENTORY_TO_NAVIGATION.md` file for detailed instructions.
